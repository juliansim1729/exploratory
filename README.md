# exploratory

## preliminary goals
An exploratory project conducted in Fall 2020. The objective was to expand my knowledge of machine learning, as well as continue practicing my statistical analysis and visualization skills. COVID-19 was chosen to be the focus of the project due to a personal interest in using data science along with statistical analysis in order to further our capabilities in medical research and practice.
